We need to create detailed datapoints for training an intent classifier for a cooking assistant chatbot. The classifier will operate in the initial stage of the conversation, aiming to align customer recipe requests with our query system. The bot begins interactions with, "Hello, what recipe would you like to cook today?"

Here are the categories for classification:

Look-based Queries (0) - Responses like "I want to cook something that looks healthy" or "something green." We will use a CLIP model to process these.
Ingredient-based Queries (1) - Queries such as "What can I cook with tomatoes and basil?" or "Recipe ideas for chicken and rice." Importantly we need a full list of ingredients! So something like "I need a low-fat dish for lunch" would fall into 3!!!
Specific Recipe Queries (2) - Direct requests for specific dishes, e.g., "How do I make lasagna?" or "Recipe for Moroccan tagine."
General Recipe Queries (3) - Broader requests like "Show me a quick breakfast recipe" or "Suggest anything for lunch."
Additionally, there are two sub-classification challenges:

Time Classification:

0: No time mentioned ("What can I cook with tomatoes and basil?")
1: Specific time mentioned ("I want a breakfast recipe under 20 minutes")
2: General urgency implied ("Show me a quick breakfast recipe")
Difficulty Classification:

0: No difficulty mentioned ("I want to cook something healthy")
1: Easy difficulty specified ("Give me a beginner recipe")
Please generate 1000 datapoints as you can in JSON format with an even distribution across query classes and a higher frequency of '0' for time and difficulty classes to reflect expected distributions.
Only return the json, nothing else! Try to be creative. Done repeat the example datapoints only new ones!!!

Example Datapoints:

["Dessert recipes with apples and cinnamon", 1, 0, 0],
["Show me a quick breakfast recipe", 3, 2, 0],
["Suggest some easy-to-make soups", 3, 0, 1],
["Recipe for chicken alfredo pasta", 2, 0, 0],
["What can I make with avocado and eggs under 20 minutes?", 1, 1, 0],
["How to prepare a simple stir fry", 2, 0, 1],
["I need a dish that uses spinach and nuts", 1, 0, 0],
["Find me a seafood dish that's visually appealing", 0, 0, 0],

["Step-by-step to make a tiramisu", 2, 0, 0],
["Looking for a light, visually appealing dessert", 0, 0, 0],
["Some easy-to-prepare lunch recipes", 3, 0, 1],
["What to cook with bacon and eggs?", 1, 0, 0],
["Instructions for a gourmet burger", 2, 0, 0],
["I'd like a recipe that looks exotic but takes only 40 minutes", 0, 1, 0],
["Show me a fast chicken dinner recipe", 3, 2, 0],
["What can I bake with chocolate and pecans?", 1, 0, 0]

This was the previous task.

You have now generated a sufficient amount of data. No let's focus on creating hard examples for time and difficulty! For that try to repeat the same examlpes with some variations and different categories. So for exampel:
["What to cook with bacon and eggs?", 1, 0, 0],
["What to cook with bacon and eggs in a short amount of time?", 1, 2, 0],
["What to cook with bacon and eggs in under 20 minutes?", 1, 1, 0],
["What to easy recipe cook with bacon and eggs?", 1, 0, 1],

For each datapoint generate all 5 variations.
